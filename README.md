## React Portfolio 


##About
This is a single page portfolio website build using React. When the user loads the page they are presented with a header, section, and footer containing links to other platforms. When the user is in the home section, (default) the user is presented with a photo of a avatar and a about section.
When the user enters into the portfolio section, a list of previous websites I have worked on is presented with a photo of them. When the user clicks on the photo, they are directed to the deployed application. When the user clicks on the resume tab, two list of my proficiencies are displayed along with a link to my downloadable resume. (Click the download icon) When the user enters into the contact section, they are presented with a form that requires their name, email address, and the subject they are contacting for. If the submission was successful, a display message will appear thanking the user for the submission. If there is a requires input left blank, a message will display asking them to enter in the information.
